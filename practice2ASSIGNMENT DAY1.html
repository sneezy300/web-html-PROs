		<h1>MY LOCKDOWN DAILY ROUTINE</h1>
		<P>
			Few weeks back the world was hit by a second deadly virus after the SWINE FLU pandemic.Prior to the heavy rise in death numbers,world leaders had to lockdown their nations which in short was going to affect COMPANIES OR FIRMS & even OUR SCHOOLS.Stayin indoors for three weeks wasn't going to be easy so i had to draw a plan to survive and below 're some of the things i did on the daily which i'd like to share in an ordered list form
		</P>
		<ol style="color: red;">
			<li>i EXERCISE once i get outta bed</li>
			<li>i eat breakfast either PORRIDGE or OAT</li>
			<li>next i get behind my desk and work (i activate irokoTv APP accounts for customers)</li>
			<li>i watch series for a while thus if theres less work</li>
			<li>i later eat lunch which is mostly BANKU or RICE</li>
			<li>i go back to continue my irokotv work online</li>
			<li>i play xbox 360 games for a while thus if theres less work again</li>
			<li>i close my irokoTv App work 6pm and prepare SUPPER for myself</li>
		</ol>
